# Commandos: Strike Force RWS notes

Status: working reverse-engineering notes, 2026-09-05. `Confirmed` below means
observed in both supplied ST05 samples or directly described by the RenderWare SDK
stream model. `Hypothesis` means the interpretation still needs cross-file or runtime
validation.

## Sources and terminology

The strongest available baseline is the preserved RenderWare Graphics 3.7.0.2 SDK
and its documentation:

- Local RenderWare Studio 2.0.1 source and bundled Graphics SDK:
  `C:\Users\eon\Downloads\rwstudio-v2.0.1-main`
- <https://github.com/sigmaco/rwsdk-v3.7.0.2>
- <https://rwsreader.sourceforge.net/>
- <https://gtamods.com/wiki/RenderWare_binary_stream_file>
- <https://gtamods.com/wiki/List_of_RW_section_IDs>

The last two are community references and are used as indices, not as evidence for
CSF-specific fields. All CSF-specific claims below come from the supplied files.

## Generic RenderWare chunk header — confirmed

All integers in the supplied PC files are little-endian. Every standard chunk begins
with this 12-byte header:

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| `0x00` | `u32` | chunk type / section ID |
| `0x04` | `u32` | payload byte count, excluding this header |
| `0x08` | `u32` | packed library version and build stamp |

The next sibling begins at `header_offset + 12 + payload_size`. A container payload
is itself a sequence of chunk headers. A `Struct` (`0x01`) is parent-dependent raw
binary data and must not be recursively scanned.

Both ST05 files use library ID `0x1C020037`. RenderWare's packed-stamp algorithm
decodes it as version `0x37002` (3.7.0.2), build 55 (`0x0037`). This matches the SDK
version expected for the title.

## Core IDs observed

| ID | Name | Role seen in ST05 |
|---:|---|---|
| `0x01` | Struct | parent-specific fixed/array data |
| `0x02` | String | texture name/mask string chunks |
| `0x03` | Extension | container for plugin chunks |
| `0x06` | Texture | sampler plus two strings and extensions |
| `0x07` | Material | color/surface data, optional texture, extensions |
| `0x08` | Material List | material index table and materials |
| `0x09` | Atomic Section | leaf geometry sector in a World BSP |
| `0x0A` | Plane Section | branch node in a World BSP |
| `0x0B` | World | collision/world tree root in `ST05_COL.rws` |
| `0x0E` | Frame List | frame transforms and per-frame extensions |
| `0x0F` | Geometry | vertices, triangles, material list, extensions |
| `0x10` | Clump | model root in `st05.rws` |
| `0x12` | Light | one light in the main sample |
| `0x14` | Atomic | binds a frame to a geometry |
| `0x1A` | Geometry List | geometry count and geometry chunks |
| `0x1F` | Right To Render | standard plugin seen on atomics/geometries |

Observed model hierarchy:

```text
Clump
├─ Struct
├─ Frame List
│  ├─ Struct
│  └─ Extension(s)
├─ Geometry List
│  ├─ Struct
│  └─ Geometry(s)
│     ├─ Struct
│     ├─ Material List
│     └─ Extension
├─ Atomic(s)
├─ optional Light(s)
└─ Extension
```

Observed collision hierarchy:

```text
World
├─ Struct
├─ Material List
├─ Plane Section (recursive BSP branches)
│  └─ ... Plane Section / Atomic Section
└─ Extension
```

## Plugin and game-extension inventory

The full archive establishes that most initially unknown IDs are standard Criterion
plugins. Chunk IDs encode a 24-bit vendor in the upper bits and an 8-bit object ID.
The RenderWare 3.7 header assigns vendors `0x01` to Toolkit, `0x05` to World,
`0x07` to RenderWare Studio, `0x08` to Audio, and `0x09` to RenderWare Physics.

| ID | Name | Full-corpus count | Payload bytes |
|---:|---|---:|---:|
| `0x00000116` | Skin Plugin | 2 | 6,802 |
| `0x0000011E` | HAnim Plugin | 139 | 3,376 |
| `0x0000011F` | User Data Plugin | 374 | 32,449 |
| `0x00000120` | Material Effects Plugin | 902 | 72,536 |
| `0x00000127` | Anisotropy Plugin | 645 | 2,580 |
| `0x0000050E` | Bin Mesh Plugin | 370 | 1,988,576 |
| `0xFFFFFF00` | Pyro Studios object metadata | 1,765 | 67,237 |

`0xFFFFFF00` is registered by the game on several RenderWare object classes and its
schema depends on the object owning the `Extension`. It is therefore decoded with
owner context, not as one global structure. The supplied corpus contains 369 Atomic,
772 Material, 622 Frame, one World Sector, and one Light instance. Atomic records are
versioned through version 11 and can carry two length-prefixed strings and optional
six-float bounds; Material and Frame records have optional metadata/name records.
Names include Spanish surface terms such as `Baldosa` and `Cemento`. Numeric field
semantics remain conservative until their runtime consumers are traced.

See [corpus findings](corpus-findings.md) for the separate RenderWare Physics
streams discovered under `Models`.

## RenderWare Physics typed records

`CommXPC.exe` contains the RenderWare Physics 3.7 readers statically. Ghidra-backed
control flow proves `0x907` is `RwpBodyDef`, `0x909` is `RwpRagdollDef`, and `0x90B`
is `RwpGenericDef`. The implemented decoder understands the tagged scalar, vector,
quaternion, matrix, transform, recursive volume, body, joint, and lookup-table
records required by every supplied Physics stream. See
[corpus findings](corpus-findings.md) for tags, reader addresses, and validation.

Body-definition typed output exposes the semantics proven by executable data flow:
mass, center of mass, principal inertia, principal-inertia orientation, scalar
inertia, and body flags. Two floats and one vector remain explicitly marked unknown.
This corrects the earlier provisional interpretation of the inertia vector and
quaternion as a body/world transform.

The low 16 bits of a Physics record tag select its type; the high 16 bits contain
the record version. This is an internal Physics serialization grammar inside the
ordinary outer RenderWare `Struct`, not another layer of 12-byte RW chunk headers.

## Typed standard structures — confirmed against ST05

The current decoder consumes the following Struct payloads exactly:

- Clump: three `i32` object counts.
- Frame List: `i32 count`, followed by `count` records of a 3x3 float rotation,
  float position, signed parent index, and flags (56 bytes per frame).
- Geometry: four 32-bit header fields followed conditionally by prelight colors,
  up to eight UV arrays, 8-byte streamed triangles, and morph targets containing a
  bounding sphere plus optional position and normal arrays.
- Material List: count plus signed remap indices.
- Material: flags, RGBA, textured flag, and three surface-property floats.
- Atomic: frame index, geometry index, flags, and unused word.
- World 3.7 header: root kind, inverse origin, aggregate counts, format, and bounds.
- Plane Section: axis/split and left/right child descriptors.
- Atomic Section: material base, counts, bounds, and collision-presence flag.
- Texture: packed filtering/addressing modes plus name and mask String chunks.
- HAnim: hierarchy metadata and node table.
- Skin: byte-sized bone counts, used-bone table, four packed bone indices and four
  float weights per Geometry vertex, 4x4 inverse matrices per bone, and the split
  header (`boneLimit`, mesh count, RLE count). Skin decoding is contextual because
  the vertex count belongs to the owning Geometry.
- User Data: array count, then an unpadded length-prefixed name, format, element
  count, and typed values for each array. Formats `1`, `2`, and `3` are respectively
  signed 32-bit integer, 32-bit real, and length-prefixed string, matching
  `RpUserDataFormat` in the Studio SDK's `rpusrdat.h`.
- Bin Mesh: mesh/material groups and topology index arrays.
- Anisotropy and Right To Render: scalar/pipeline metadata.
- Material Effects: CSF uses effect and slot type `4` (dual pass). Material
  payloads store source/destination blend modes, a texture-present flag, a complete
  embedded Texture chunk, and a zero second-slot terminator. ST05 uses source
  `rwBLENDZERO` (`1`) and destination `rwBLENDSRCCOLOR` (`3`), producing base color
  multiplied by the dual texture. Atomic payloads are a
  four-byte pipeline-enabled flag. Across ST05 all 902 payloads decode exactly:
  645 Material records and 257 Atomic records. All 645 embedded texture references
  end in `_Lm` and select 33 unique external DXT1 files in the map's `Textures`
  directory. The other 27 of the directory's 60 `*_Lm.dds` names occur in the
  CSF-specific scene tail rather than the standard Clumps. Exactly 257 of the 369
  Clump Geometries carry two UV sets, matching the 257 MatFX-enabled Atomics; the
  other 112 Geometries have no UV arrays.
- RenderWare Physics Body and Ragdoll definitions: recursive tagged records,
  including all volume/body/joint structures present in the extracted corpus.

All 4,782 applicable model structures and all 26 applicable collision structures
decode without a boundary/count failure. Geometry array sizes consume their Struct
chunks exactly.

The Skin layout has two independent checks. Each of the two CSF chunks is 3,401
bytes and belongs to a 153-vertex Geometry with five bones; the complete formula is
`4 + 5 + 153*4 + 153*16 + 5*64 + 12 = 3401`. RenderWare Studio's bundled
`2wpv_ragdoll_*_coords.dff` files provide a separate RW 3.4 sample: 5,740 vertices,
26 bones, 24 used bones, and a 116,504-byte Skin payload satisfying the same layout.

All 374 User Data payloads consume exactly with no alignment padding assumed. One
representative 85-byte Geometry extension contains three single-value integer arrays:
`hayTagID = 1`, `bNivelTest = 0`, and `FVF.UserData = 0x3003`.

RenderWare's streamed triangle words are ordered as vertex 1, vertex 0, material,
vertex 2 rather than the in-memory `RpTriangle` order. Both candidate arrangements
were range-tested against vertex/material counts: all 369 ST05 geometries uniquely
select the streamed arrangement, with zero memory-order or ambiguous cases.

World Sector triangles retain the in-memory order instead: vertex 0, vertex 1,
vertex 2, material. In ST05, the third word spans each sector's full vertex range,
while the fourth word is bounded by the World's 339 materials.

The OBJ exporter uses the first morph target that contains positions, the first UV
set, optional normals, the validated streamed triangles, and `material_N` groups.
Geometry is currently exported in its local frame; applying Frame List transforms
and extracting texture images remain future work.

## Sample inventory and anomalies

### `st05.rws`

- Physical size: 28,979,398 bytes.
- 244 standard top-level Clump chunks occupy `[0, 0x00DD9095)`.
- Those clumps contain 369 geometries/atomics and 645 Texture chunks.
- At `0x00DD9095`, a repeating CSF-specific region begins. Its first 12 bytes happen
  to look like type `0x00016FC0`, size 99, and the normal library stamp, but the next
  record does not start at the implied chunk boundary.
- The region is 14,458,929 bytes and contains embedded ordinary chunk headers,
  transforms, numeric IDs, and length-prefixed names such as `ARBOL_3`.

The tail begins with 23 `ARBOL_3` instance records containing embedded Matrix
chunks. At `0x00DD9BA2` they are followed by a standard RenderWare World chunk that
extends to physical EOF (its declared size overruns the file by 32 bytes). The
parser conservatively recovers this World when its stamp, leading Struct child, and
EOF boundary all agree; the preceding instance records remain opaque.

### `ST05_COL.rws`

- Physical size: 6,187,753 bytes.
- Starts with one World chunk and a 15-entry Material List.
- The World declares 6,189,685 payload bytes, or 6,189,697 bytes including its
  header. The physical file is therefore 1,944 bytes shorter than declared.
- The rightmost Plane Section inherits the same EOF truncation.

This may be a damaged/cut sample or a tolerated exporter defect. Do not rewrite the
declared sizes until another copy or another stage confirms the intended behavior.

## Parsing rules used by rws-man

1. Read only complete 12-byte headers.
2. Perform all end calculations in 64 bits.
3. Clamp declared payloads to their containing range and flag truncation.
4. Recursively parse only known container types; keep Struct and unknown chunks raw.
5. Require nested candidates to use the stream's library stamp. This avoids
   manufacturing chunks from float/index data.
6. Preserve original bytes exactly unless a user explicitly edits them.

These rules are intentionally conservative. Typed editing will be enabled one schema
at a time after round-trip tests exist for that schema.
